## Problem Definition:
It's critical to have an online platform that meets the needs of both teachers and students
in the modern era of online learning. Our project is an e-learning web platform to help close the
communication gap between instructors and their students by:
* Giving them a quick and simple way to ask questions and receive answers from the
course instructors.
* Organizing course contents using a simple interface that allows the instructors to post
links to course contents for their students.
* Simplifying the assessment process by providing an online assessment feature for the
instructors so they can create and edit assessment questions and use them to build quizzes
within a specific course.
